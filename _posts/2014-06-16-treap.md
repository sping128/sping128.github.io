title: Implemented Treap for the first time
---
As a way to solve [Problem E](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/436/E) from ZeptoLab Code Rush 2014, I decided to implement [Treap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap) for the first time. Treap is a randomized binary search tree that the maximum height of the tree is about <code>O(log n)</code> (similar to AVL tree). It's easier to implement than a normal AVL tree. Why do I have to implement it? I need to perform these operations in <code>O(log n)</code>: Add, Remove, Find the sum of the <code>k</code> smallest elements. My implementation was added [here](https://github.com/sping128/cpt/tree/master/library/data_structure).

Note that this **problem E** can also be solved by other data structures: Binary Indexed Tree, Cartesian tree or Priority Queue, because this problem only requires calling this operation, "Find the sum of the <code>k</code> smallest elements", multiple times with the non-ascending value of <code>k</code>.
